<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Starting with a homemade red sauce, these Tex-Mex enchiladas are faster and easier to make than their Mexican forefathers, but still so delicious.

    <li>2â€‰1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
</ul>

<h4>Enchilada Filling</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 (5 inch) corn tortillas</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2/3 cup shredded cooked chicken</li>
    <li>2/3 cup pepper Jack cheese</li>
    <li>1/3 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    <li>1/3 cup chopped green onions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p>Melt butter with olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt; cook and stir until onion starts to turn golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in flour, chile powder, cumin, chipotle powder, black pepper, oregano, cayenne, and cinnamon. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add tomato paste and mix until fully combined. Pour in chicken broth and whisk until smooth.</p></li>
    <li><p>Increase heat to high and bring sauce to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 10 minutes. Taste and season as desired. Blend sauce with an immersion blender.</p></li>
    <li><p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p></li>
    <li><p>Lightly brush tortillas with oil. Heat a small cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Heat tortillas until flexible, about 30 seconds per side.</p></li>
    <li><p>Cover the bottom of the skillet with a scoop of enchilada sauce. Place a tortilla on top and add 1/2 of the chicken, 1/3 of the Jack cheese, and 1/2 the cilantro and green onions. Spoon on more sauce and repeat layers, finishing with sauce and the remaining cheese.</p></li>
    <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts and sauce is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes.</p></li>
